    // C# - What is OOP?

    // OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

    // Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

    // Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

    //        OOP is faster and easier to execute
    //        OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
    //        OOP helps to keep the C# code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
    //        OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
    //        Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.


    // C# - What are Classes and Objects?

    // Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.
    //Look at the following comparison to see the difference between class and objects:

    // Example 1
    // class
    //      Fruit

    //  objects
    //      Apple
    //      Banana
    //      Mango


    // Example 2
    //  class
    //      Car

    //  objects
    //      Volvo
    //      Audi
    //      Toyota

    // So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
    // When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.
    // Everything in C# is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods.
    // For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.
    // A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

    // Create a Class
    //To create a class, use the class keyword :
    //Create a class named "Car" with a variable color:
    public class Car
    {
        public string Color = "red";
    }

    // When a variable is declared directly in a class, it is often referred to as a field(or attribute).
    // It is not required, but it is a good practice to start with an uppercase first letter when naming classes.
    // Also, it is common that the name of the C# file and the class matches, as it makes our code organized.
    // However it is not required (like in Java).

    // Create an Object
    //An object is created from a class. We have already created the class named Car, so now we can use this to create objects.
    //To create an object of Car, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword new:

    //Create an object called "myObject" and use it to print the value of color:
    public static void CreatingACarObject()
    {
        Car myObject = new Car();
        Console.WriteLine(myObject.Color);
        // Note that we use the dot syntax (.) to access variables/fields inside a class (myObject.color).

        // You can create multiple objects of one class:
        Car myObject1 = new Car();
        Car myObject2 = new Car();
        Console.WriteLine(myObject1.Color);
        Console.WriteLine(myObject2.Color);
    }
}
