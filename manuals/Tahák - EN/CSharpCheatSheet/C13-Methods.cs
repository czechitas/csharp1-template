    // C# Methods
    // A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
    // You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
    // Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.
    // Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.

    // Create a Method
    // A method is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses().
    // C# provides some pre-defined methods, which you already are familiar with, such as Main(),
    // but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:

    public static void MyMethod()
    {
        // code to be executed
        Console.WriteLine("I just got executed!");
    }

    // Example Explained
    //  - MyMethod() is the name of the method
    //  - static means that the method belongs to the Program class and not an object of the Program class.
    //  - void means that this method does not have a return value.You will learn more about return values later in this chapter
    //  Note: In C#, it is good practice to start with an uppercase letter when naming methods, as it makes the code easier to read.

    // Call a Method
    //To call(execute) a method, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon;
    //In the following example, MyMethod() is used to print a text(the action), when it is called:

    //Example
    //Inside Main(), call the myMethod() method:
    public static void MethodCallingMethod()
    {
        MyMethod();
    }
    // Outputs "I just got executed!"

    // A method can be called multiple times:
    public static void MethodCallingMethodMultipleTimes()
    {
        MyMethod();
        MyMethod();
        MyMethod();
    }
    // I just got executed!
    // I just got executed!
    // I just got executed!
}
