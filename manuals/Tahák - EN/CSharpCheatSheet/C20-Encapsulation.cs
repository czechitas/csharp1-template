    // Properties and Encapsulation

    // Encapsulation is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users
    // To achieve this you must:
    //      - Declare fields/variables as private
    //      - Provide public get and set methods, through properties, to access and update the value of a private field

    // Properties
    // Private variables can only be accessed within the same class (an outside class has no access to it).
    // However, sometimes we need to access them - and it can be done with properties.
    // A property is like a combination of a variable and a method, and it has two methods: a get and a set method:


    public class Person
    {
        private string name; // field

        public string Name   // property
        {
            get { return name; }   // get method
            set { name = value; }  // set method
        }
    }

    // Example explained
    // The Name property is associated with the name field.
    // It is a good practice to use the same name for both the property and the private field, but with an uppercase first letter.
    // The get method returns the value of the variable name.
    // The set method assigns a value to the name variable.
    // The value keyword represents the value we assign to the property.

    class Program
    {
        static void Class()
        {
            Person myObject = new Person();
            myObject.Name = "Roberto";
            Console.WriteLine(myObject.Name); // Roberto
        }
    }

    // Automatic Properties (Short Hand)
    // C# also provides a way to use short-hand / automatic properties, where you do not have to define the field for the property,
    // and you only have to write get; and set; inside the property.
    // The following example will produce the same result as the example above.
    // The only difference is that there is less code:

    // Using automatic properties:
    class Person2
    {
        public string? Name { get; set; } //property
    }

    class Program2
    {
        static void UsingAutomaticProperties(string[] args)
        {
            Person2 myObject = new Person2();
            myObject.Name = "Roberto";
            Console.WriteLine(myObject.Name); // Roberto
        }
    }

    // Why Encapsulation?
    // Better control of class members (reduce the possibility of yourself (or others) to mess up the code)
    // Fields can be made read-only (if you only use the get method), or write-only (if you only use the set method)
    // Flexible: the programmer can change one part of the code without affecting other parts
    // Increased security of data
}
